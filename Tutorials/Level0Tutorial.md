# This is an <h1> What is a Parallel Discrete Event Simulation:
  
Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES), sometimes called distributed simulation, refers to the execution of a single discrete event simulation program on a parallel computer. Because of the large amounts of time on sequential machines, PDES can be used to assist with engineering, computer science, economics and military application ventures. This collection of sequential simulatorsâ€”possibly running on different processors are logical processes communicating exclusively by exchanging messages.  
	A discrete event simulation model assumes the system being simulated only changes state at discrete points in simulated time. The simulation model jumps from one state to another upon the occurrence of an event. For example, a simulator of a store-and-forward communication network might include state variables to indicate the length of message queues, the status of communication links (busy or idle), etc.
